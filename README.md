# My Personal Project

## Are you interested in:
- movies?
- tv shows?
- k-dramas?
- anime? 

## Have you ever been asked *What's your favourite movie?* and every single movie you've watched leaves your brain?

**Then this application is for you.**

This project was born out of an interest to find an easy way to track my favourite movies and TV shows
since I watch so many. I wanted a tracker that can also allow me to write my own reviews and ratings as well
as return statistics of what I have watched. I wanted to merge something like Letterboxd with SpotifyWrapped to bring 
forward a tracker that not only allows you to make a list of all the movies you have watched but also an application 
that can give you some insight into your favourite titles, genre, and other statistics.
